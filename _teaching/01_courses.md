### Statistical Signal processing
*Master course, Eindhoven University of Technology, masters EE and AI&ES, 2018 - ongoing*

As variability and noise affect all measurements, all signals are inherently stochastic variables. Deterministic signal processing approaches are thus inadequate for many real-world applications.  Whether a radar signal to detect a plane, an electrocardiogram to diagnose heart conditions, or a GPS signal to guide an autonomous car, virtually every engineer deals with real-world signals affected by several sources of noise and interference. Understanding how to handle and process signals in the presence of uncertainty, e.g., “random” signals, is thus fundamental for every student aiming at becoming an engineer. This course provides the basic tools necessary for understanding and processing random signals. 

The course is divided into four parts, including a blend of reading and video materials, quizzes, and assignments. The first part covers topics of probability, random variables, and random processes and is a prerequisite for the following parts. The second part dives into estimation theory and methods, including maximum likelihood, least-square, and Bayesian estimation. The third part explains the application of estimation theory in the context of spectral analysis. The final part covers hypothesis testing and detection theory, with applications for detecting a deterministic signal in noise. 

### Technology for care and cure
*Master course, Eindhoven University of Technology, masters EE,  2024 - ongoing*

As part of the course Technology for Care and Cure, I give a guest lecture on Mechanical Ventilation focusing on respiratory modeling for estimation of patient efforts and lung mechanics, and on patient ventilatory asynchronies.

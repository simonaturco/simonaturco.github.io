On November 16-17 2023, we visited Brussels for the joint meeting of the IEEE-EMBS Benelux chapter and the National Committee on Biomedical Engineering (NCBME).

Annual meeting of IEEE-EMBS Benelux chapter

During the annual meeting, the BM/d had a very big contribution with the keynote speaker by our part-time professor Geert Langereis, two selected oral presentations by Tom Bakkes and Nishith Chennakeshava, and 12 poster presentations. We ended the day with the best presentation award for Nish, and a lovely social event.

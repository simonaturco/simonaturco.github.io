I am assistant professor of statistical processing of biosignals at the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/biomedical-diagnostics-lab" target="_blank"> Biomedical Diagnostics lab</a> (BM/d), which is part of the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems" target="_blank"> Signal Processing Systems</a> group, Electrical Engineering department, <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/" target="_blank">Eindhoven University of Techonology</a> (TU/e). I am a member of the Eindhoven Young Academy of Engineering and the chair of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) Benelux chapter.

Research
======
My research is devoted to quantitative model-driven analysis of medical images and biosignals,  with application ranging from cancer imaging to perioperative care and hemodynamic monitoring. As cancer growth and aggressiveness relate to angiogenesis, i.e., the formation of chaotic network of leaky microvessels, my research in cancer diagnostics is devoted to developing novel imaging solutions for assessment of angiogenesis. To go beyond structural imaging, ultrasound and MRI dynamic imaging with injection of contrast agents are used to extract structural, functional, and molecular information on angiogenic vasculature at different spatial and temporal scales. Additionally, correlation with genomic information may reveal the underlying mechanisms producing the observed imaging features. In the context of perioperative monitoring, I focus on model-based analysis of biosignals for accurate prognosis and timely identification of patients at risk. By combining model-based feature extraction with data-driven approaches for optimal feature selection, I aim at developing effective risk prediction models to support clinical decision making. In general, I strive to facilitate the translation of research, driven by industrial and clinical needs, through tight collaborations with top healthcare partners.

Teaching
======
Since 2018, I am the designer and responsible teacher for the course Statistical Signal Processing, which is part of the master curriculum in <a href="https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/graduate-school/masters-programs/electrical-engineering" target="_blank"> Electrical Engineering</a> and the master curriculum in <a href="https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/graduate-school/masters-programs/artificial-intelligence-engineering-systems" target="_blank"> Artificial Intelligence & Engineering Systems</a> at TU/e.

Background
======
I obtained my BSc and  MSc in Biomedical Engineering from the School of Engineering of the University of Pisa (Italy), both summa cum laude. My master graduation project was carried out at Philips Research (Eindhoven, the Netherlands). In 2015, I obtained a professional doctorate in engineering (PDEng) in Healthcare system design from the Stan Ackermans Institute at the Eindhoven University of Technology, which was awarded best project in the designer program in Electrical Engineering. In 2018, I completed my PhD at the Eindhoven University of Technology, with thesis entitled “Pharmacokinetic modeling in cancer: from functional to molecular imaging of angiogenesis”. Both my PDEng and PhD were carried out at the BM/d lab. Here, after a short post-doctoral fellowship, I became assistant professor in statistical processing of biosignals in 2018, with tenure in 2021. I have served as a board member of the Women in Science Eindhoven network (2018-2022), and I am now serving as chair of the IEEE-EMBS Benelux chapter and as a member of Eindhoven Young Academy of Engineering.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Pisa, both awarded cum laude. For my master thesis, I move to the Netherlads to carry out a research internship Philips Research. After graduation, I pursued a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), focusing on quantitative imaging of angiogenesis in prostate cancer using DCE-MRI. This project received the TU/e Design Project Award for the best design project in Electrical Engineering.

I continued at TU/e with a PhD in Electrical Engineering, where I developed pharmacokinetic models for cancer imaging, bridging functional and molecular imaging approaches. My PhD research was recognized with multiple awards, including the IEEE EMBS Best Paper Award and Best Poster Awards at the European Symposium on Ultrasound Contrast Imaging.

Since 2018, I have been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at TU/e, with tenure awarded in 2021. My research focuses on statistical signal processing for biomedical applications, particularly in cancer imaging and perioperative monitoring. I have led several national and international collaborations, including a visiting scholar position at Stanford Medicine and a guest researcher role at the Amsterdam UMC.

My research has been supported by several competitive grants and fellowships. I am the main applicant and project leader of the NWO Open Technology Program grant “MOMENTUM” (~€1.1M), which focuses on nanobubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging for cancer diagnostics. I was awarded the Hanarth Fonds Fellowship (€250k) for integrating genomics and imaging in prostate cancer care, and the KNAW Van Leersum Travel Grant to support international collaboration on multiparametric ultrasound for pancreatic cancer. Additional funding includes NVIDIA GPU Grants (2017, 2018), and the MRE-Stimuleringsfonds Grant (€50k) for wearable sensing technologies.

I am the responsible lecturer for the Statistical Signal Processing course at TU/e and have received two BOOST grants for enhancing blended and hands-on learning.

I serve as Chair of the IEEE EMBS Benelux Chapter, I am a Senior Member of IEEE, and a member of the Eindhoven Young Academy of Engineering.

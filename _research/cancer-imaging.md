title: "Multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer imaging"
excerpt: "Cancer is a global health challenge. Timely and accurate detection and diagnosis, together with effective therapy monitoring are essential in the fight against cancer. Based on the established link between cancer and the formation of (neo)vessels to support tumor growth (angiogesis), several imaging modality have been developed to detect early angiogenic changes. Non-invasive, radiation-free ultrasound and MRI imaging are particularly interesting for angiogenesis imaging. However, mostly qualitative assessment is currently performed in the clinical routing, possibly missing important information hidden in these rich spatio-temporal imaging sets. In my research, I developed methods for quantification of MRI and US imaging, and extraction of effective cancer biomarkers. I strive to combine model-driven and data-driven approaches, to obtain interpretable, physics-based biomarkers for improving cancer diagnostics.  1<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

title: "Interpretable radiomics and radiogenomics of prostate cancer"
excerpt: "Prostate cancer is the second most common and one of the most lethal forms of cancer in western men. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Multiparametric MRI is currently the recommended imaging modality for prostate cancer. However, it is not sufficiently accurate to replace systematic biopsies. In this line of research, we combine model-driven approaches for feature extraction with data-driven appraoches for optimal classification, with the goal of improving prostate cancer diagnostics. <br/><img src='/images/mri_cover.jpg'  width="300" align="right">"

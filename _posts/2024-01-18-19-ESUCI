Looking back at two fantastic days at the European Symposium on Ultrasound Contrast Imaging 2024. 
Lots of inspiring talks from committed researchers who are pushing the envelope of contrast ultrasound for imaging and therapy.
It was a pleasure to meet old colleagues and friends from all over the world and discuss future exciting collaborations.
We also had the opportunity to present our most recent work on CUDI for uterine disorders (Ferenc Kandi, Eva J.E. de Bock) and the honor to be awarded the best poster for the biology/clinical session (Tinting Wang).

Hemodynamic monitoring in hospitals involves the continuous assessment of the cardiovascular system to understand how the heart and blood vessels are functioning. This process is crucial for patients at risk of deterioration, and advancements in monitoring technologies have expanded the options available at the bedside. Traditional invasive methods, such as pulmonary artery catheterization, are giving way to safer and more continuous non-invasive measurements of key parameters like blood pressure and cardiac output. Despite these improvements, challenges remain, including the need for more complete hemodynamic information, uncertainties in interpreting standard variables, and late detection of patient deterioration. This field of research focuses on overcoming these limitations by proposing new theoretical frameworks and experimental tests. The goal is to enhance the specificity and accuracy of hemodynamic measures using standard hospital equipment, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and outcomes.

Continuing this line of research, the PISANO project seeks to leverage technological advances in pathophysiological modeling, unobtrusive sensing, monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI) towards improving hemodynamic measurements in critical care. The main hypothesis is that the standard hemodynamic monitoring technology might not be used up to its full potential. In this context, we explore how to adapt existing critical care technology for the purpose to improve existing measurement quality, or developing new measurement strategies, aiming at extracting new parameters and obtain early and comprehensive information on the hemodynamic status of patients at risk of deterioration.  A major thrust is on radical innovations towards widespread use of ultrasound (US) technology. Cuff with integrated US might enable continuous peri-operative monitoring to detect hemodynamic instabilities earlier and with higher accuracy. More in general, using such new non-invasive smart measurement technique aims to replace current invasive methods to monitor functional hemodynamic parameters, which reveal useful for early detection of patient deterioration and for guiding critical care treatments

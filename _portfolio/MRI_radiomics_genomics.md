title: "Radiomics and radiogenomics of prostate cancer"
excerpt: "Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer and one of the most lethal in western men. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Multiparametric MRI is currently the recommended imaging modality for prostate cancer. However, it is not sufficiently accurate to replace systematic biopsies. In this line of research, we extract quantitative parameters from multiparametric MRI and combine them by machine learning for improving prostate cancer diagnostics. Additionally, we investigate the link between relevant MRI features and genomic features of aggressive prostate cancer <br/><img src='/images/mri_cover.jpg'>"

<!-- Cancer is a global health challenge. Timely and accurate detection and diagnosis, together with effective therapy monitoring are essential in the fight against cancer. Based on the established link between cancer and the formation of (neo)vessels to support tumor growth (angiogesis), several imaging modality have been developed to detect early angiogenic changes. Non-invasive, radiation-free ultrasound and MRI imaging are particularly interesting for angiogenesis imaging. However, mostly qualitative assessment is currently performed in the clinical routing, possibly missing important information hidden in these rich spatio-temporal imaging sets. In my research, I developed methods for quantification of MRI and US imaging, and extraction of effective cancer biomarkers. I strive to combine model-driven and data-driven approaches, to obtain interpretable, physics-based biomarkers for improving cancer diagnostics.  -->

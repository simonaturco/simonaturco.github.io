title: "Prediction of patient deterioration"
excerpt: "In perioperative care, the timely prediction of patient deterioration has as a pivotal role in ensuring optimal patient outcomes and the efficient allocation of resources within hospital settings. The ability to foresee changes in a patient's condition before they escalate into critical states is paramount for healthcare providers seeking to deliver high-quality and patient-centered care. In this line of research, we develop novel strategies for timely prediction of patients at risk. <br/><img src='/images/patient_deterioration.png' width='400px'>"

In critical care medicine, timely identification and intervention in response to patient deterioration play a pivotal role in shaping clinical outcomes. The ability to foresee and act upon early warning signs can be a determining factor between life and death. Failure to rescue, defined as the inability to promptly recognize and address deteriorating patient states, poses a significant challenge in critical care settings. Studies indicate that a substantial proportion of adverse events leading to morbidity and mortality in hospitals are preceded by warning signs that go unnoticed or are not acted upon in a timely manner. Current methods for predicting pattient deterioration are mostly based on scoring systems that assigns numerical values based on a few vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Since this methods rely on predetermined threshold, do not work well in all patient populations. The low specificity may lead to alarm fatigue. Morevoer they are inable to capture context, and they may miss transient and rapid changes as they are calcualted at predefined intervals.

In this line of research, we investigate novel approaches to predict patient deterioration timely and more accurately, by fully exploiting the wealth of information available in the hospitals.


In a first study, we investiagated whether <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286818" target="_blank">unanticipated admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)</a> could be predicted using variables extracted from the electronic medical record acquired at different phases of the perioperative period (before, during, and after surgery). We achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.83â€“0.88) by combining intra- and early postoperative factors with preoperative patient factors. This emphasizes the need for clinical decision support tools in post anesthesia care units with regard to postoperative patient allocation.
